Multivariate analysis with lightcone metric to replicate IVT---(U850*TMQ)^2 concat (V850*TMQ)^2 lightcones---spacetime decays applied appropriately.
past_depth: 10 
future_depth: 3 
c :1                
past_K: 20 
future_K: 20 
lc decay: 0.1 
Note, hopefully fixed MPI issue with the environment for this one.
